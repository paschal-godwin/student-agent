🧑‍🎓 Student Agent

An AI-powered study assistant that helps students summarize textbooks, generate flashcards, and answer questions from study materials. Built with Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI.

✨ Features

📘 Topic Summarizer → generate detailed, structured summaries from uploaded PDFs or preloaded textbooks.

🧠 Flashcard Generator → creates Anki-style Q&A cards from any topic for active recall practice.

🔍 Q&A Assistant → ask natural language questions and get concise answers with references to source material.

📑 Source Highlighting → shows where answers came from (filename, page, and snippet).

🔐 API-Key Support → option for users to provide their own OpenAI API key to reduce hosting costs.

📚 How It Works

PDFs are uploaded or loaded from a local book directory.

Documents are split into chunks with metadata (filename + page).

Chunks are embedded with OpenAI embeddings into a FAISS vectorstore.

Queries (summarize / flashcards / Q&A) are answered using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Outputs are displayed in a clean, student-friendly Streamlit UI.
